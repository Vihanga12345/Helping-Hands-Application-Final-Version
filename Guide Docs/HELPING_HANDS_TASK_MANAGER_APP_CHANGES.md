### **🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

1. **Helper Profile Bar Data Population Issue**
   - **Problem**: Helper profile bars on job detail pages showing default/empty values for name, rating, job count, job types, and profile picture
   - **Root Cause**: `getJobDetailsWithQuestions()` method was not fetching helper data when jobs had assigned helpers
   - **Fix**:
     - Enhanced `getJobDetailsWithQuestions()` to include helper join: `helper:users!assigned_helper_id(id, first_name, last_name, phone, email, profile_image_url)`
     - Added helper statistics calculation (rating, completed jobs, job types) in Dart
     - Injected helper fields into job details payload: `helper_first_name`, `helper_last_name`, `helper_profile_pic`, `helper_avg_rating`, `helper_completed_jobs`, `helper_job_types`

2. **Helper Name Display Issue**
   - **Problem**: Helper profile page showing "Unknown Helper" instead of actual name
   - **Fix**:
     - Enhanced field normalization in `Helpee14HelperProfilePage._loadHelperProfile()`
     - Added fallback mapping for multiple field name variations
     - Added safety check to ensure `full_name` is never empty

     - Properly split job types string for display

4. **Code Changes**
